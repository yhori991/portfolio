## Bio

Hi, I'm Yoshihiro Hori, a ML engineer at SyntheticGestalt, where I read papers, build models, manage data pipelines, and set up and maintain infrastructure.

I've worked with a variety of data that are used to build predictive models, including images, videos, protein sequences, and molecular structures, ranging from thousands to tens of billions of records.

As I spend more time as a practitioner, I've become increasingly fascinated by the software ecosystem that makes it all possible. As such, I'm contributing to conda-forge by night and also fiddling around with Nix in my spare time.
